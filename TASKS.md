# Overview

Open `src/App.js` and describe the code for the component.

# Styling

1. Change the "OK" button's color to blue (any blue).
2. Change the "Cancel" button's color to any other color.

# Using Semantic UI

Open the [documentation for Semantic UI React's Button component](https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/button).

1. Add icons (any icons) to both buttons.
2. Make the buttons larger using a Semantic UI size

# Programming with React

1. Set up the component to use state, either with hooks or by converting it to a class.
2. Using state, make it so clicking the "Cancel" button will hide both buttons.
